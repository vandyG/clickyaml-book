clickYaml: A Python Odyssey
===========================

`clickYaml`_ is an python package that reads a ``.yaml`` file
and creates click commands out of it.

This book talks about each and every step that went into this project
and solution to all the challenges faced while working on it. This book
will cover topics like setting the up the development environment to 
unit testing to ultimately publishing the package on `pypi`_.

This project has been developed by a python novice and in no way it 
claims to provide the best solution to each step; instead it paints
the picture of my journey and all the effort that went into it during
the development.

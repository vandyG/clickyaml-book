The Makefile
============

Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex tasks with dependencies.
The functionality of makefile and make utility are beyond the scope of this book. You can find loads
of good articles and resources to understand them.

.. seealso::

    `GNU make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html>`_ for more information on make and
    makefile.

The `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage>`_ template 
adds a bunch of useful make rules. These rules help automate a lot of procedures which otherwise you 
would be running manually.

Run ``make help`` to understand each rule.

.. code-block::

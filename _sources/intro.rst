clickYaml: A Python Odyssey
===========================

`clickYaml`_ is an python package that reads a ``.yaml`` file
and creates click commands out of it.

This book talks about each and every step that went into this project
and solution to all the challenges faced while working on it. This book
will cover topics like setting the up the development environment to 
unit testing to ultimately publishing the package on `pypi`_. It will 
also touch upon the steps went into creating this book.

This project has been developed by a python novice and in no way 
claims to provide the best solution; instead it paints the picture of the 
dev's journey and all the effort that went into the project during the 
development.

So if you are looking for the *best approach* **I am afraid I can't provide you that**.
